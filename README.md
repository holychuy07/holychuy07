## About me ðŸ‘‹


Hi! I'm Holychuy, a beginner learning programming to build my future in tech.

My Goal
-
I want to create AI agents using no-code tools to help automate tasks and improve efficiency. However, I know that to build truly powerful AI solutions, I need a solid foundation in programming. That's why I'm here----- learning and growing every day!


Why I'm Learning to Code
-
While no-code platforms make things easier, understanding how programming works will allow me to:
  Customize AI agents beyond basic functionalities.
  Solve complex problems more effectively.
  Build innovative tools that integrate no-code and traditional coding.


What I'm Currently Learning
-
Programming Basics: Starting with fundamental concepts.
Web Development: Learning how websites and apps work.
Automation & AI: Exploring how AI can be used to create smart solutions.
No-Code Development: Experimenting with platforms like Make, N8n, and Relevance AI.

Tools & Technologies I'm Exploring
-
Languages: Currently learning the basics (still exploring which to focus on).
No-Code Tools: Make, N8n, Relevance AI.
Development Environment: Linux (Xubuntu), Virtual Box.
Version Control: Learning Git and Github to manage my projects.

My Vision
-
I believe AI and automation can change the way businesses operaWhy Learn Programming? To understand how AI and automation work, I need to develop coding skills.
--------------------te, and I want to be part of that transformation. My goal is to launch AI agents that help small businesses automate tasks, save time, and boost productivity---all while making it easy to use with no-code solutions.

I know this is just the beginning, but I'm excited to document my journey, share what I learn, and connect with like-minded people. If you're also into AI, automation, or programming, let's connect! -- - -- -
